How to get involved with Hackathon Hackers

## Becoming a moderator
Moderators of Hackathon Hackers are tasked with /deleting troll threads (e.g. joke threads about Donald Trump making HH great again), being an example of a highly valuable member of the community, and helping establish healthy dialogues on news and issues in the hackathon community.

Because of the responsibilities that come with being a moderator, a select few members are chosen to become moderators. However that's not to say it's impossible to do so!

One of the easiest ways to become a moderator is to be active. Frequently engaging in healthy and civil discussions and reporting content and comments that violate the code of conduct are qualities that potential moderators should possess.

### ~~Consensus administration~~

// TODO: paragraph outdated?

~~A key part to becoming a moderator is understanding how the moderator team works on an internal basis.  The HH moderator team operates on a consensus model where all moderators vote on major actions such as additions to the team and revisions to the code of conduct. Under this model, all members of the team are equal to each other and equally invested in the development of the community. In other words, the moderator team is more-or-less representative of the community itself.~~

### Top-down administration

The HH moderator team operates on a top-down system with [Dave Fontenot](http://github.com/hellyeah) acting as director of the group with all other moderators answering to him. While the subordinate moderators can still vote on major decisions, Dave ultimately reserves the right to veto any such decisions or implement his own changes without consensus if he believes it's better for the community. // TODO: could this still qualify as consensus?
