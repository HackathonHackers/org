* HH Open Data - There is a [scrape](http://hh.gd/scrape) and [Google Big Query](http://hh.gd/scrapecsv) done by Alex Kern  of the public groups in the HH ecosystem. You can discuss working with this data in [HH Data Hackers](https://www.facebook.com/groups/datahackers) and see the [HH Data Contributor Spotlight](https://medium.com/hackathon-hackers/hh-data-contributor-megan-ruthven-871b078b30d8) on Megan Ruthven for inspiration.
* [Hackathons.com](www.hackathons.com) - This domain has untapped potential! Currently it hosts a a link to the slack group, but we're open to having other projects on it such as a [hackathon schedule](https://github.com/HackathonHackers/upcoming-hackathons).
