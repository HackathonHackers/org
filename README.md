Who Are We
----
Hackathon Hackers is an all-inclusive hackathon community, run for and by the community. This repository organization exists to allow anyone to find out about, and contribute to, the way this community is governed. Every aspect of our growth and moderation  policies are meant to be as transparent and open as possible.

If you ever see something on any repo that you feel could be improved, feel free to submit a pull request for a change to be made. **This is your community as much as it is ours.**

Moderation
----
The Hackathon Hackers main group (as well as a few subgroups) is run using the opensource moderation tool, [HackBot](https://github.com/HackathonHackers/hackbot). When the appointed moderators type the command `/detete` in response to a comment or post they believe is in violation of our [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/HackathonHackers/code-of-conduct), or does not belong in the group being moderated, the entirety of the deleted content will be removed, and pushed to a file on a [public GitHub repository](https://github.com/HackathonHackers/moderation), along with the details of why it was removed, and by whom. The same goes for every usage of `/ama`, `/thread` and `/close`.

The moderation team (**mods**) is voted on by the community as a whole. **The structure of choosing mods works as follows:**
- A person is nominated for modship by [filling out this form](http://goo.gl/forms/Xgbztid81U).
- At the end of every term, the Subgroup Leaders vote to add, remove, or renew modship for nominated and existing moderators.
- Prior to the elections, new nominees are given an opportunity to campaign by submitting a proposal on their personal vision for the community to the [Hackathon Hackers Medium publication](https://medium.com/hackathon-hackers/).

All newly elected mods must agree to practice empathy when responding to content that should be removed. The purpose of the moderation team is to make sure that their assigned group remains a place where everyone feels welcome.

**The duties of the moderation team inclde:**
- Deleting content that violates our [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/HackathonHackers/code-of-conduct).
- Reaching out to community members, informing them of why their content was taken down.
- Reporting to the admin when they feel as if a community member must be banned, and giving them a comprehensive update on why they feel this is the right move to make.

The terms of the moderators are **four months long**, but can be terminated at any point during that period at the discretion of the Subgroup Leaders. The decision to make the terms four months long is meant to accommodate the fact that most of our community is made up of students, whose time available volunteer may vary by semester.

Adminship
----
The admin of the Hackathon Hackers group exists solely to oversee the moderation team, and perform tasks that the moderators don't have the power to do. This includes actions such as:
- Banning users
- Pinning posts
- Modifying the sidebar
- Adding a newly appointed admin

There is only one active admin.

The Subgroup Leaders have the power to call for a new election to take place, and the admin can choose whether or not to participate. The admin can retain their position either until they assign an interim administrator, or a new admin has been elected. The (interim) admin is expected to add the winner of the election as an administrator and remove themselves within 24 hours of it concluding.

Subgroup Leadership
----
The [Subgroup Leaders](https://www.facebook.com/groups/hhleadership/) is the group for admins who manage HH affiliated [subgroups](https://github.com/HackathonHackers/groups). To become an HH affiliated subgroup, you must meet one of the following criteria:
- 1 week old, 5+ posts, 250+ members
- 3+ weeks old, 10+ posts this week, 100+ members

If your group meets these requirements, fill out and submit the following [form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1D-Y770lR3GTMWY3musJQounsQ956Ex09G95SIFaY6XM/viewform) and await approval. Once approved, submit a pull request to have your group added to the GitHub repo, as well as a request to join the Facebook group.
